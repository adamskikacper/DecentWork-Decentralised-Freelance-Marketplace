Code Inconsistencies and Areas for Improvement

1. React.FC Usage
   Issue: Many components still use React.FC which is no longer recommended
   Files affected: 70+ components across the codebase
   Fix: Remove React.FC and use direct function syntax with explicit prop typing
2. Console Statements
   Issue: Numerous console.log, console.error, and console.warn statements throughout the codebase
   Files affected:
   src/components/organisms/SignupForm/index.tsx (4 instances)
   src/shared/services/auth.service.ts (30+ instances)
   src/app/providers/AuthProvider.tsx (15+ instances)
   Multiple other files
   Fix: remove debug statements
3. Inline Styles
   Issue: Several components use inline style attributes instead of Tailwind classes
   Files affected:
   src/components/organisms/JobDetails/index.tsx
   src/components/organisms/JobCard/index.tsx
   src/shared/ui/Progress/index.tsx
   src/components/atoms/ProgressBar/index.tsx
   Fix: Convert to Tailwind CSS classes
4. Mock Data in Components
   Issue: Hardcoded mock data directly in components instead of services
   Files affected:
   src/components/organisms/ProfessionalSection/index.tsx (skills array)
   src/components/organisms/PortfolioSection/index.tsx (portfolio items)
   src/components/organisms/HiringPreferencesSection/index.tsx (project types, budget ranges)
   src/components/organisms/HeroSection/HeroSection.tsx (stats data)
   Fix: Move mock data to services
5. HTML Elements Instead of Radix UI
   Issue: Many components use raw HTML elements instead of Radix UI components
   Files affected:
   src/components/organisms/JobPostForm/index.tsx (input, textarea, select, label, button)
   src/components/organisms/BidForm/index.tsx (input, textarea, label)
   src/components/organisms/JobDetails/index.tsx (button elements)
   src/shared/ui/Header/index.tsx (button elements)
   src/components/templates/DashboardTemplate/index.tsx (button)
   Fix: Replace with corresponding Radix UI components
6. Duplicated Guard Components
   Issue: Guard components exist in both src/shared/guards/ and src/components/organisms/
   Files affected: AuthGuard, ClientGuard, FreelancerGuard, RoleGuard
   Fix: Remove duplicates from organisms directory, keep only in shared/guards
7. Missing Index Files
   Issue: Some directories lack proper index.ts files for clean exports
   Fix: Add index.ts files where missing to maintain consistent barrel exports
8. Inconsistent Error Handling
   Issue: Different error handling patterns across components
   Fix: Standardize error handling with consistent toast notifications
9. Component Size and Complexity
   Issue: Some components are too large and handle multiple responsibilities
   Files affected:
   src/components/templates/DashboardSidebar/index.tsx (420+ lines)
   src/components/organisms/JobForm/index.tsx (complex form logic)
   Fix: Break down into smaller, focused components
10. TypeScript Issues
    Issue: Inconsistent type definitions and some any usage
    Fix: Improve type safety with proper interfaces and remove any types
11. Accessibility Issues
    Issue: Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes in some components
    Fix: Add proper accessibility attributes and semantic HTML
12. Performance Issues
    Issue: Potential re-renders and inefficient state management
    Fix: Implement proper memoization and optimize component re-renders
13. Import Organization
    Issue: Inconsistent import ordering and grouping
    Fix: Standardize import order (React, third-party, internal)
14. Unused Code
    Issue: Some components and utilities may be unused
    Fix: Remove dead code and unused imports
15. Configuration Files
    Issue: Some configuration inconsistencies
    Fix: Standardize configuration across all config files
